# membrane-budding
Simulating membrane budding using atomistic, coarse-grained and DTS simulations.

This repository contains the scripts used to analyze atomisctic and CG MD trajectoris and codes to perform Dynamic Triangulated Surface (DTS) simulations as described in the paper "Delineating the shape of COPII coated membrane bud" by Sanjoy Paul, Anjon Audhya, Qiang Cui
